# tStandalone, a standalone mod for Terraria 1.4.0.5!

tStandalone is an open-source fork of tModLoader's 1.4 beta branch (NOTE: This is a fork of tModLoader, but it is not a mod loader. It simply depends on tModLoader's patcher). tStandalone is **not** and **never** will be a mod loader, nor is it associated with tModLoader in any way, shape or form..
tStandalone is a combination of different modifications for Terraria 1.4.0.5 by myself (Stevie) and other contributors.

**Note**: tStandalone is currently unreleased. Do not ask for an ETA as there is none.
